# DRIWAKE

The problem DRIWAKE solves:-
We have seen too many road accidents which occur due to several reasons and some of them are uncoditional health due to harmful gases inside the truck's cabin and Drowsiness of the driver ,

Nowadays, Long hours spent in truck cabins expose drivers to various pollutants and contaminants, which can have adverse effects on their health. Monitoring air quality allows for early detection of harmful substances, enabling drivers to take necessary precautions or seek medical attention if needed and it also leads to drowsiness of drivers which is the main reasons behind road accidents. It is natural for the drivers who take long drives to doze off behind the steering wheel. In this reckon 5.0, we build Air quality and drowsiness detection system that will alert the driver as soon as the harmful gases starts increasing inside the cabin and degrading the air quality inside the cabin and driver fell drowsy,

Safety: Poor air quality can impair a driver's ability to concentrate and react quickly, increasing the risk of accidents on the road. By monitoring air quality in real-time, drivers can be alerted to dangerous conditions, reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by impaired cognitive function.

Environmental Impact: Some truck cabins utilize internal combustion engines for heating or cooling, which can emit harmful pollutants into the cabin air. Monitoring air quality can help identify inefficient systems or maintenance issues, leading to reduced emissions and a smaller environmental footprint.

Data Collection and Analysis: Collecting data on air quality within truck cabins can provide valuable insights into trends and patterns regarding pollutant levels, helping researchers and policymakers better understand the impact of transportation on air quality and develop more effective mitigation strategies.

it will help truck drivers to monitor the air quality and drowsiness on their screens and get alerted before any mishappen occurs.
